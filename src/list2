TimeRegistration component and its child components, along with their types and functionalities.

    Calendar component:
    The Calendar component is responsible for displaying a calendar UI and allowing the user to select a date. It takes two props, selectedDate and onDateClick, and ensures type safety for these props with TypeScript.

The selectedDate prop is of type Date and is used to highlight the selected date on the calendar. The onDateClick prop is a callback function of type (date: Date) => void, which is called when the user clicks on a date. The Calendar component also imports and uses external libraries like React Big Calendar and Moment.js for rendering the calendar UI.

    RegistrationList component:
    The RegistrationList component is responsible for displaying a list of time registration entries for a given date. It takes two props, registrations and onDelete, and ensures type safety for these props with TypeScript.

The registrations prop is an array of time registration entries for the selected date and is of type Array<TimeRegistrationEntry>, where TimeRegistrationEntry is an interface defining the structure of a time registration entry. The onDelete prop is a callback function of type (id: string) => void, which is called when the user clicks on the delete button next to a registration entry. The RegistrationList component also imports and uses external libraries like React Table and Moment.js for rendering the registration entries in a table format.

    TimeRegistrationForm component:
    The TimeRegistrationForm component is responsible for rendering the form for adding or editing time registration entries. It takes two props, handleSubmit and initialData, and ensures type safety for these props with TypeScript.

The handleSubmit prop is a callback function of type (data: TimeRegistrationFormData) => void, which handles the form submission for registering or updating a time registration entry. The TimeRegistrationFormData interface defines the structure of the form data, including the date, start time, end time, and description fields. The handleSubmit function checks for errors and dispatches the appropriate actions to update the state and add/edit the registration entry.

The initialData prop is an object of type TimeRegistrationEntry | null, which is used to pre-populate the form with existing data when editing a time registration entry. If the initialData prop is null, the form renders with empty fields. The TimeRegistrationForm component also imports and uses external libraries like React Hook Form and Moment.js for handling form submission and date/time formatting.

    TimeRegistrationSummary component:
    The TimeRegistrationSummary component is responsible for displaying a summary of the time registration entries for the selected date. It calculates the total number of hours registered for the selected date and checks if the total exceeds 100 hours. If the total exceeds 100 hours, the component displays a notification to the employee to alert them of the excessive hours. The component is also written in TypeScript for type safety.

The TimeRegistrationSummary component takes one prop, registrations, which is an array of time registration entries for the selected date and is of type Array<TimeRegistrationEntry>. The component calculates the total number of hours by iterating through the registrations array and adding up the duration of each entry. If the total exceeds 100 hours, the component displays a warning message to the user.

    TimeRegistration component:
    The TimeRegistration component is the main component that handles the rendering and logic for the time registration feature. It uses the other components and hooks to manage the state and handle user interactions. The component initializes the state, which can be an array of time registration entries, and ensures type safety throughout the component with TypeScript.

The TimeRegistration component includes functions to handle adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as updating the selected date. The component uses React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage the state and update the UI based on user interactions. The TimeRegistration component also handles errors and edge cases, such as submitting an empty form, entering invalid input, or editing an entsry that no longer exists in the state.

The TimeRegistration component imports and uses the other child components like Calendar, RegistrationList, TimeRegistrationForm, and TimeRegistrationSummary to render the UI and handle user interactions. It passes the necessary props to these child components and updates their state when necessary.

    App.tsx:
    App.tsx is the entry point of the application and it renders the TimeRegistration component. It is written in TypeScript and ensures type safety throughout the application. The App.tsx file also imports and uses external libraries like React and Redux for managing the global state of the application.


    CREATE THE APP IN THIS ORDER:
        Create the TimeRegistrationEntry interface:

    The first step is to create an interface called TimeRegistrationEntry. This interface defines the structure of a time registration entry, including properties such as date, start time, end time, and description. We use TypeScript to ensure type safety for this interface.

        Create the Calendar component:

    The Calendar component is responsible for displaying a calendar UI and allowing the user to select a date. We use an external library like React Big Calendar to render the calendar UI and Moment.js to handle date formatting. The component takes two props: selectedDate and onDateClick. The selectedDate prop represents the currently selected date, and the onDateClick prop is a callback function that takes a date as an argument and is called when the user clicks on a date in the calendar.

        Create the RegistrationList component:

    The RegistrationList component is responsible for displaying a list of time registration entries for a selected date. We use an external library like React Table to render the entries in a table format and Moment.js to handle date formatting. The component takes two props: registrations and onDelete. The registrations prop is an array of TimeRegistrationEntry objects representing the time registration entries for the selected date, and the onDelete prop is a callback function that takes an entry ID as an argument and is called when the user clicks on the delete button next to an entry.

        Create the TimeRegistrationForm component:

    The TimeRegistrationForm component is responsible for rendering the form for adding or editing time registration entries. The component takes two props: handleSubmit and initialData. The handleSubmit prop is a callback function that handles the form submission for registering or updating a time registration entry, while the initialData prop is used to pre-populate the form with existing data when editing a time registration entry.

        Create the TimeRegistrationSummary component:

    The TimeRegistrationSummary component is responsible for displaying a summary of the time registration entries for a selected date. The component calculates the total number of hours registered for the selected date and checks if the total exceeds 100 hours. If the total exceeds 100 hours, the component displays a warning message to the user.

        Create the TimeRegistration component:

    The TimeRegistration component is the main component that handles the rendering and logic for the time registration feature. It uses the other components as children and React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage the state and update the UI based on user interactions. The component includes functions to handle adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as updating the selected date. It also handles errors and edge cases, such as submitting an empty form, entering invalid input, or editing an entry that no longer exists in the state.

        Create the App.tsx file:

    The App.tsx file serves as the entry point of the application and renders the TimeRegistration component. It uses external libraries like React and Redux to manage the global state of the application and ensure type safety with TypeScript.

    Overall, each step in creating the files and components for the TimeRegistration feature plays a critical role in providing a comprehensive and robust time registration feature, ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining type safety throughout the application.

Overall, the updated TimeRegistration component and its child components provide a comprehensive and robust time registration feature, ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining type safety throughout the application. The component uses external libraries and React hooks to manage state and handle user interactions, while also ensuring type safety with TypeScript.
