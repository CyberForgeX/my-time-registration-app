The updated TimeRegistration component consists of five main components that work together to provide a comprehensive time registration feature. The STRICT TYPESCRIPT components are as follows:

    Calendar component - This component is responsible for displaying a calendar UI and allowing the user to select a date. It takes in two props: selectedDate and onDateClick. The selectedDate prop is used to highlight the selected date on the calendar, and onDateClick is a callback function called when the user clicks on a date. The component is written in TypeScript and ensures type safety for these props.

    RegistrationList component - This component is responsible for displaying a list of time registration entries for a given date. It takes in two props: registrations and onDelete. The registrations prop is an array of time registration entries for the selected date and is used to display the list of entries. The onDelete prop is a callback function called when the user clicks on the delete button next to a registration entry. The component is also written in TypeScript to ensure type safety for these props.

    TimeRegistrationForm component - This component is responsible for rendering the form for adding or editing time registration entries. It takes in two props: handleSubmit and initialData. The handleSubmit prop handles the form submission for registering or updating a time registration entry. It checks for errors and dispatches the appropriate actions to update the state and add/edit the registration entry. The initialData prop is used to pre-populate the form with existing data when editing a time registration entry. This component is also written in TypeScript to ensure type safety for these props.

    TimeRegistrationSummary component - This component is responsible for displaying a summary of the time registration entries for the selected date. It calculates the total number of hours registered for the selected date and checks if the total exceeds 100 hours. If the total exceeds 100 hours, the component displays a notification to the employee to alert them of the excessive hours. The component is also written in TypeScript for type safety.

    TimeRegistration component - This is the main component that handles the rendering and logic for the time registration feature. It uses the other components and hooks to manage the state and handle user interactions. The component initializes the state, which can be an array of time registration entries. It includes functions to handle adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as updating the selected date. Additionally, the component handles errors and edge cases, such as submitting an empty form, entering invalid input, or editing an entry that no longer exists in the state. The TimeRegistration component is also written in TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the component.

    App.tsx - This is the entry point of the application and it renders the TimeRegistration component. It is written in TypeScript and ensures type safety throughout the application.

Overall, the updated TimeRegistration component and its child components provide a comprehensive and robust time registration feature, ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining type safety throughout the application.
